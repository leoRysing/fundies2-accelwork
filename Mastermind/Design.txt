- interface ILoColor: Represents a list of Color objects

- class MtLoColor implements ILoColor: Represemts the Empty case for the list of colors

- class ConsLoColor implements ILoColor: Represents the Cons case for the list of colors
	Color first
	ILoColor rest

ILoColor and its associated classes, as shown in the purpose statements, represent lists of colors. They are used to represent guesses in the Game of Mastermind, 
as well as the color palette you can use in a game, and the secret you are trying to guess. There are methods here used to compare two list of guesses, in order
to see how many colors are correct and nearby between a guess and secret. Other methods work to allow for helpful implementations, that allow for getting specific
volotd in s lidt, randomiing a list of colors given a palette, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- class GuessPair: Represnts a pair of a list with a string. The list is a list of colors and the string is the output recieved when the list of colors was compared with the secret
	ILoColor list: the list of colors compared with the secret
	String guessOutput: the result of running the list through the comparison with the secret

- interface ILoGuessPair: Represents a list of the afformentioned GuessPairs

- class MtLoGuessPair implements ILoGuessPair: Represents the empty case for a list of Guess Pairs 

- class ConsLoColor implements ILoGuessPair: Represents the cons case for a list of Guess Pair
	GuessPair first
	ILoGuessPair rest

GuessPair and ILoGuessPair are classes that help collect previous guess list of colors matched with a string that represents how correct a certain guess is compared
to a secret. These classes can check if a given guess string is a "winning state" by parsing the first number and making sure it is the same size as the width of the
secret. Besides this, these methods can also draw the previous guesses.

- class YourWorld extends World: Represnts the World that we will use throughout the game. Big bang uses instances of this class to render and process the game
	ILoColor colorPalette: Represents all the possible colors in the instance of the game
	ILoColor secret: Represents the secret that the user must guess in order to win
	int width: how many circles wide the secret and guess must be
	int numGuesses: how many guesses the user has left to huess the secret
	ILoColor currGuess: the current guess that the user is building up
	ILoGuessPair prevGuesses: the list of all the previous guesses the user has made along with the result of the guess   

YourWorld is the main class used to represent the game of Mastemrind. As shown, it uses ILoColor, ILoGuessPair, and ints to represent the different variables
needed in the game of Mastermind. The secret is usually randomized, while the rest of the ILoColor's are specifically instantiated at the start.
